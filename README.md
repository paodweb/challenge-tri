# Challenge triathlon

Tiny web project to count points of licensees of the [DEL](https://www.landerneau-triathlon.com).
Licensees' points are based on the races they complete.

This application is used by administrators that fill points.

This is a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) project bootstrapped with [Create Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue).
